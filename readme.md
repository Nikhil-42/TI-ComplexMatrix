### CE C/C++ Toolchain Template

This project seeks to use the [TI-84 Plus CE C/C++ Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain) to allow users to solve complex systems of linear equations using CE models.

The systems should allow for the construction of a complex matrix and support the usage of Gauss-Jordan elmination to solve for it's complex variables.
